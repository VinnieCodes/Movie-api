OBJECTIVE - To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

SUMMARY 
1. My role for this project was to build the back-end part of a movie application. 
2. Decisions that I took were adding data via Mongosh in the terminal and creating many endpoints. This was tedious because of the unforgiving nature of the command line, but I powered through it.
3. In the future something that I would do differently, would be adding to the quantity and quality of the data that I provided.
4. Some of the lessons that I learned were, how to use MongoDB, Mongo compass, the command line, and more.
